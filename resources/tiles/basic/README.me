Basic tiles are extracted from Carcassonne-infografia-bolsillo-single.pdf available online:

Tiles in the document are 650x650 px but include safe padding for printing. They were then cropped
to 512x512 px using Gimp. Gardens were added also using Gimp. Outlines of features were created
using Inkscape.
